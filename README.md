#### Briefly about me

I am 27 years old and live in Stockholm. I also have a degree as a sociologist. After three years in working life, I decided to train as a web developer. It has been fun, educational and sometimes difficult. I'm starting the last semester soon and I'm looking forward to new challenges!
